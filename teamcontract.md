subtitle: Grace, Abby and Maria's Team Contract

# **Guiding Principles**
* collaboration
* respect
* trust
* fun!
* open-mindedness
# **Purpose**
We want to design an innovative tool that will help visitors achieve an engaging and enjoyable experience in a museum. Our final product should be accessible, immaginative and clearly useful. 
# **Group Roles**
* Designated Delegator: The D.D is responsible for managing tasks, assigning jobs and (kindly) keeping people focused and productive.
* Creative Consult: The C.C. is meant to keep our work open-minded and imaginative. They will promote good brain-storm practices and attempt to think outside of the box.
* Logic Liason: The L.L keeps our feet on the ground, reminding the group of the project guidelines, good design practices (as outlined by Norman) and feasibility for the semester. 
# **Division**
We will change roles week to week to bring fresh perspectives and avoid power dynamics. We also will try our absolute best to divide work evenly and commmunicate openly when we feel that we are doing too much or too little. The Designated Delegator will help facilitate these discussions about uneven workloads (and will be vigilant, looking for potential discrepencies). 
# **Plan** 
Our intention is to collaborate on all deliverables. However, if it becomes too difficult to find time to work collectively on assignments, we will revert to our weekly group roles and assign tasks as they relate to our roles. In addition, we will create a google-drive folder in which we will put all of our work so we can edit and build on eachother's ideas. 
# **Meetings**
We will have two meetings per week (one before each class) in which we finalize our deliverables for that class, address any questions or problems with the group and outline future steps. 
# **Accountability** 
When we finish a task, we will tell the group (via slack or the group chat) so other members can read and add to the work. We will aim to have things done the night before class (but be understanding if a group member is having a tough week and needs a little extra time.) If a group member thinks they will not be able to complete a task, they will let the group know as early as possible (without fear of judgment). The designated delegator will check in with group members the night before things are due to make sure the work is on track (and assign help as needed). 
# **Rewards and Punishments**
We will celebrate success with good food (specifics will depend on our cravings and mood!). We will not punish eachother and instead will try to remain empathic and remember that college life can be incredibly stressful. We will trust that we are all trying our best and employ open communication in bad situations. In the event that the group member is not pulling their weight, we will have group discussion to address the situation and create a plan for concrete improvement. This plan will include regular check-ins between the slacking group member and the delegator to make sure that tasks are accomplished. 
# **Follow-Up**
Because of illness and scheduling problems, this contract has not yet been reviewed by Maria and will not be finalized until all group members have read it and added their ideas. We will revisit this contract once a month and address its effectiveness, making changes as needed.
